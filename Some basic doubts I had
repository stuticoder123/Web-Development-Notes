Q.2)Is video tag a semantic tag?
Ans.) No, the <video> tag is not a semantic tag.Semantic tags, like <header>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>, give meaning to the content they contain, helping search engines and developers understand the page structure.

<figure> tag with a <figcaption> to provide descriptive context.
 <figure>
  <video controls>
